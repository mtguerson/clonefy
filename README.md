# Pipefy Clone with React and JavaScript API

This project is a simplified clone of Pipefy, focusing on the drag-and-drop functionality among columns, similar to Trello. It utilizes React for the frontend and a simple JavaScript API to manage the data. The aim of this project is to demonstrate the construction of an interactive application with React, integrated with a simple backend API.

## Technologies Used

- React: Used to build the user interface with reusable components.
- JavaScript: Programming language used to create the application logic and the simple backend API.
- CSS: For styling the components and the application layout.
- Styled-components: Utilized for styling within the component files in React, allowing for a more modular and dynamic approach to CSS.
- Other libraries and tools like React DnD for drag-and-drop functionality.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your machine. These tools are necessary to run the project locally.

## Setup and Execution

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>
   ```

2. Enter the project directory:
   ```
   cd <PROJECT_DIRECTORY_NAME>
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
   or if you are using yarn:
   ```
   yarn
   ```

4. To start the application in development mode, run:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
   or if you are using yarn:
   ```
   yarn start
   ```

   This will start the development server and open the application in your default browser.

## Project Structure

Describe the directory structure of your project here, explaining what each file or directory does, for example:

- `src/components`: Contains all reusable React components.
- `src/api`: Contains the JavaScript API simulation for data management.
- `src/styles`: CSS style files for application customization.
